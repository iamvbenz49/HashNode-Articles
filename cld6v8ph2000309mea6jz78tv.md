I started to code in April 2021, But I am gonna share the things I learned in 2022. At the beginning of the year, I was about to face my 12th board examination. I didn't study much because COVID made me a lazy guy. My 12th board results were not great, Ok let's speak about the coding part. At the beginning of the year, I heard about leetcode and with leetcode we can crack FAANG-type companies. I tried to solve questions leetcode question with python because I started my coding journey with python. I would spend 2 to 4 hours per question and still I wasn't able to solve the edge cases. At that time I met a guy Who has solved more than 200 questions and I asked him what to do. He told me to learn DSA, So started searching for "DSA tutorials in Python". I found code basics channel the I learned about Lists, time and space complexity But I wasn't able to understand Linked List . It made me depressed, then my board exam came I didn't study DSA for a while. After my exams were over I again started to learn DSA from Amulya's Academy with Python Still I had a hard time understanding Linked List. So I thought maybe Python was a poor language of choice for DSA. So I started learning DSA from Tanmay Sakpal using C++ and also I learned a few things like HTML, CSS, JS, ES6 and React These were the days my procrastination habit started to build a little by little, Instead of coding I would binge watch Movies/Series and scrolling Instagram. I wasted 4 months in this process, Then I read a book called deep work by Cal Newport, That book made me deactivate my Social media accounts. People should read that book at least once. But still, I wasn't able to quit it completely I would more time opening those apps on browser. But then I found Hamza, He is self improvement YouTuber. His words were real and true. He told people that You are living pathetic life because of their worst mental health and that If people improve their mental health they would be able to do anything in Life. Then I started exercising and meditating daily It drastically improved my mental health and I started becoming more productive. Then I came across Kunal Kuswaha's DSA course at the end of September, I started watching it and learned the basics of JAVA. At the end of October, My college began, And I moved from my native to Chennai . Sadly I joined a college with 96% attendance criteria, But still, it was just a test for my time management and productivity skills, I would have college from 7.50 to 3.00 I would try to code with the time that was left for me Day by day I was just being consistent and I almost learned most of the DSA concepts from @[Kunal Kushwaha](@kunalk) . Now I only have DynamicProgramming, graphs and trees left . And I have solved 91 problems on leetcode so far . I would improve my problem-solving skills further. I am planning to start open source contribution at the beginning of the second semester. When I joined my college they gave us a coding platform named SkillRack, I solved around 1600 problems there. The questions were relatively easy when compared to other coding platforms. With that, I would like to thank @[Kunal Kushwaha](@kunalk) for telling me to write a Wrap-up blog on 2022.
